            <h4>DOMESTIC SHIPPING</h4>
            <p>
                Orders typically take 2-3 working days to be processed and dispatched (unless otherwise
                mentioned in the product description section). Once dispatched, delivery takes 2-7 working days,
                depending on the delivery pin code. If the order includes more than one item, the dispatch time
                will be determined by the item that takes longest to be dispatched.</br> </br>
                
                Working days exclude Saturday, Sunday, and gazette holidays. Unforeseen circumstances like
                strikes which affect business operations or force businesses to close down for the day will be
                considered non-working days and impact delivery timelines.
                On delivery day, our courier partner will attempt to contact you through a call or SMS to
                handover your package. Please note the courier partner will make three attempts to deliver your
                order. If the partner is unable to reach you the order will be returned to us. </br> </br>
